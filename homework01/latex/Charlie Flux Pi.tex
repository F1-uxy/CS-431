\begin{abstract}
This report examines the performance of calculating pi with varying thread and step counts.
The results show the importance of parallelizable algorithms for speeding up runtimes and that deminishing returns can be found when the step count becomes large.

\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the impact of multiple threads for execution time and number of steps on calculation accuracy while calculating pi using the OpenMP library on Telepas.

\section{Methodology}
Two methods for estimating pi were used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monte Carlo Method:} A random point generation method that calculates the ratio of points inside a circle.
    \item \textbf{Area of Circle Method:} Uses the integral approach to approximate pi.
\end{itemize}

For experiments measuring time, core counts \(C\) were chosen from the set:
    \[
    C = \{1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128\}
    \]
with a fixed accuracy of 100,000,000 units.

For the accuracy tests, a fixed core count of \(64\) was used, with step counts \(A\) from the set:
    \[
    A = \{1, 10, 100, \dots, 10^{9}\}
    \]
The accuracy tests of pi are measured to 11 significant figures.


\subsection{Experimental Setup}
All tests were ran on Telepas. Experiments were repeated 20 times and the average was calculated for each experiment. \\
Data was filtered using the Interquartile Range Filter to remove points that do not lie between the first and third quartile as a consequence of the the unreliable data caused by the unlocked variable frequencies on Telepas.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Critical vs Atomic}
Figure~\ref{fig:critical_atomic} compares the execution time of critical and atomic sections of estimating pi using the area of the circle method.
This figure shows that there is a decrease in performance when increasing the number of threads for this algorithm, this is because of the overhead of creating a new child process.
Furthermore, the critical section suffers more from this decrease in performance as each thread must execute serially during this section therefore, an increase in threads logarithmically increases the waiting time at this section.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Further Speedup}
Further investigating the area of a circle code I implemented a reduction data scope on the summation of the area. \\
This removed the bottleneck that both atomic \& critical sections imposed therefore, the code now scales with more threads. \\
The increased performance of the code is seen in Figure \ref{fig:speedup}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparing Speed}
Figure \ref{fig:comparingspeed} shows the performance difference of the Monte Carlo \& Area of a circle methods. Both experiments ran using reduction data scope for the inside circle counts and summation of area respectively.\\
The Monte Carlo method performs worse compared to the Area of Circle method due to the computational overhead of generating random numbers in every iteration. In contrast, the Area of Circle method relies primarily on arithmetic operations, which are efficiently handled by the ALUs, resulting in faster execution.\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Accuracy with Varying Units}
    \label{fig:comparingspeed}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparing Accuracy}
Figure~\ref{fig:accuracy} shows the absolute percentage difference that a given estimation is to the true value of pi with a varying amount of steps that could be used.
The serial and parallel versions of the Monte Carlo method are very similar therefore, it would be safe to assume that the amount of threads given to a pi calculation does not affect the accuracy of that calculation. 
Instead the accuracy depends on the amount of guesses the Monte Carlo method has.  \\
The area of a circle method has a large advantage over the Monte Carlo method as it is using an integral approach of calculating pi instead of a random approach.

\section{Conclusion}
The experiments demonstrates that speedups can be found in both the Monte Carlo and Area of a Circle methods if bottlenecks are removed.
It also highlights the importance of removing bottlenecks where the cost of spawning a new thread is greater than the performance gained.
The area of a circle method sees better calculation accuracy than the Monte Carlo method due to its integral approach whereas the Monte Carlo method struggles to maintain accuracy from the randomized nature of the method.
